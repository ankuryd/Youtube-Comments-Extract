ROW_COUNT denotes number of videos per catergory.

COLUMNS_COUNT denotes number of different categories you are sampling comments for.

Create excel sheet with video links of same category pasted in single column.

The script runs for a single video in one execution.

Constraints:
1. 300 seconds quota for one execution. (So preferably use videos with less than 60-70K comments)
2. 5000000 cells per spreadsheet. (Delete extra columns to avoid this or make a copy of each new sheet)

You can automate this process using time based triggers for script execution.
